Repo for my attempts at working out the NixOS config(s) that I want.

Currently working on configuring home manager + flakes configs for my laptop and desktop. Active folders are the *-testing subfolders, 'old' is shockingly not used and just kept as a reference for now.

## Desktop
Currently actually using neither home-manager nor flakes.
Experimenting with labwc as my window manager.
Git workflow for /etc/nixos: I fetch the changes from /etc/nixos as a remote on this repository(like so: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1425892/how-do-you-merge-two-git-repositories), and then push them up to gh.
- [ ] figure out a better way of managing the repo on this PC :)
